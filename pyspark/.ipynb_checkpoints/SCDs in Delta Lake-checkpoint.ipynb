    "SCD's (Slowly Changing Dimensions) are fairly easy to implement with Spark 3.0 and Delta Lake.\n",
    "In the traditional data warehousing world, where everything is stored in SQL tables, we used to have a construction like the below (from Kimball's [Data Warehouse toolkit](https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Ralph-Kimball/9781118530801?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=GR&utm_content=The-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit&selectCurrency=EUR&w=AFFMAU9SYY661SA8V9F5)) for a Type 2 SCD:\n",

    "![SCD2 Example](img/scd2_ex.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a **Products** dimension table which stores data from one or more source systems. As we have a type 2 SCD, every time a record is updated in source, a new record is added into the dimension table, with the updated version of the source record. There are various records for the same source entity, showing the 'condition' of the source record in various points in time, Historical information is retained this way. The primary key of the record in the source system (e.g. our ERP) is the **SKU** column (hence the NK - natural key designation). The extra columns we have in our SCD 2 Product Dim are the following:\n",
    "- **Product Key**: this is the PK (primary key) in the DIM Product table itself. As we have multiple rows for each original record in the source system, to retain the various versions, we can have multiple records with the same NK but with a different PK, of course. This PK has no intrisic meaning, hence it's also called a surrogate key, and it is an auto-increment field in most cases.\n",
    "- **Row Effective Date**: this shows when this particular record (so this version of the source record) was loaded from the source system. The first time we load the dimension table, it is customary to use a date in the distant past, like 1/1/1900 or something. \n",
    "- **Row Expiration Date**: this shows when the record/version stops being active. So every time an SCD2 attribute is changed in the source system, the expiration date of currently active record gets updated to the reference date (or datetime) of the current loading batch, and another record is added with Effective date having this reference date, and Expiration Date something like 12/31/9999.\n",
    "- **Current Row Indicator**: this is a flag that shows if the record is active or has expired. As an expiration date of 12/31/9999 shows the record is active too, sometimes this field is ommitted. It could also be used to indicate a record has been deleted from the source, or we could use another field for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same thing in Delta Lake, although it's not necessary. To start with it, let's load a sample file, which will play the role of the source system. Now please note, that if you have installed Spark 3.0 and pyspark enabled Jupyter in your laptop, and want to try this there, you should kick this off using something like\n",
    "> pyspark --packages io.delta:delta-core_2.12:0.7.0\n",
    "\n",
    "as the guys who created Spark note in [Learning Spark 2nd ed.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-spark-2nd/9781492050032/) to have the Delta Lake capabilities available in your Jupyter session."
