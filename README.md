# Example Code from Matt Pro

Hello, this is a repo I've created to publish some example code to share with others.
As I haven't had much time, there is a limited number of examples, currently.

1. [Creating Slowly Changing Dimensions](https://github.com/mantzos/modern-examples/blob/main/pyspark/SCDs%20in%20Delta%20Lake.ipynb) in Databricks Delta Lake, using PySpark and Spark SQL
2. [Performing text translation and sentiment analysis](https://github.com/mantzos/modern-examples/blob/main/pyspark/Text%20Analytics%20with%20Synapse%20and%20Cognitive%20Services.ipynb), using Azure Synapse Analytics and Cognitive Services, on a Synapse Spark notebook.
3. [Comparing DAX and SQL](https://github.com/mantzos/modern-examples/blob/main/TSQL/BI%20Metrics%20in%20PoBI%20vs%20SQL.ipynb) for calculating standard BI metrics, on an Azure Data Studio notebook.
