# Example Code from Matt Pro

Hello, this is a repo I've created to publish some example code to share with others.
As I haven't had much time, there is a limited number of examples, currently.

1. [Creating Slowly Changing Dimensions](https://github.com/mantzos/modern-examples/blob/main/pyspark/SCDs%20in%20Delta%20Lake.ipynb) in Databricks Delta Lake, using PySpark and Spark SQL
2. [Example query](https://github.com/mantzos/modern-examples/blob/main/postgresql/Calculate%20Inventory%20from%20Entry%20-%20Exit%20Times.ipynb) in PostreSQL to calculate complex metrics, leveraging the specific characteristics of a dataset
3. [Comparing DAX and SQL](https://github.com/mantzos/modern-examples/blob/main/TSQL/BI%20Metrics%20in%20PoBI%20vs%20SQL.ipynb) for calculating standard BI metrics, an Azure Data Studio notebook.
